## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r r1}
a <- 5
b <- 2
r1 <- a+b
r2 <- a-b
r3 <- a*b
r4 <- a/b
r5 <- a^b
v1 <- c(r1,r2,r3,r4,r5)
print(v1)
v2 <- c("sum", "difference", "product", "quotient", "power")
print(v2)
df <- data.frame(operation = v2, Results = v1)
print(df)
df[2,1]
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
